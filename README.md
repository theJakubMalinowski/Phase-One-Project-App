## Tech

This application is utilizing Rapid API specifically the Online Movie Database API by API Dojo database, to search movies by name, or actors to see movies they are in. The Application has the ability for the user to like results and save them into a list, under "Saved Movies". This list can be toggled by the "See My Liked Movies" Button. Additionally the application has a feature to wipe the results and search field to start a new search by keying the "escape" button, whilst keeping your Saved Movies list unchanged!
